# SVG-Name-tags-generator
Simple python scripts that generate nametags for laser engraving/cut according to an excel name list file, with size of tags/working area/font that you define in another excel file + merging nametags according to working area. This was coded with a lot of help coming from chatgpt because i'm really bad a coding.
