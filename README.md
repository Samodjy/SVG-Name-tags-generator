# SVG-Name-tags-generator
Simple python scripts that generate nametags for laser engraving/cut according to an excel name list file, with size of tags/working area/font that you define in another excel file + merging nametags according to working area. This was coded with a lot of help coming from chatgpt because i'm really bad a coding.

added a green frame around merged files to ensure the right mesurement in the laser software (xtool creative is really bad with measurement from svg) 

The "convert script, should let me make a copy of the merged files that are empty in xtool creative tool (only showing the green frame, it seems that xtool doesnt like what i've done) when i open the svg with inkscape and save a copy, xtool is reading the svg proprely. So : convert script. --- actually still not working
